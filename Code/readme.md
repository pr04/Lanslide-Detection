I have worked on this code with the help of another repository where the core work was done by a different team. 
You can view their repository here: (https://github.com/kushanavbhuyan/HR-GLDD-A-Global-Landslide-Mapping-Data-Repository).
Please note that the code is actively being developed, so there may be changes over time.
